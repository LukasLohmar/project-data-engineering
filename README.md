## build and run

1. run ``docker compose up -d`` in root folder to start the project as a new docker container
    - if ``docker compose`` errors out with ``error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in %PATH%, out: ''`` -> change **credsStore** to **credStore** in ``%USERPROFILE%/.docker/config.json`` on windows or ``$HOME/.docker/config.json`` on linux
    - depending on OS or distribution ``docker compose`` is not a known command and/or aliased to ``docker-compose``
    - the python container runs on the **first** start only and loads the sample data into the database, to remove the data and reset the projects use ``docker compose down --volumes``
    - **a access token is generated by the python script and printed to the docker terminal of the python image** \
    ![alt](./images/python_import_finished.png)
    - the generated token can be used to test the endpoints with swagger ui or by calling plain get requests to the endpoints
2. services available
    - api on port 6500
    - database on port 6501 -> USER=postgres, PASSWORD=postgres, DB=data-system-db
    - api-documentation is available [here](http://localhost:6500/swagger) when the container is running
